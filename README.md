WARNING: This script hasn't been tested yet. Hopefully I'll be back in a
couple of weeks to tidy it up, finish it off, and document it properly.
I'm just checking it in now so I don't lose it before I get a chance to
sort it all out.

This repo contains things that help you get cijoe running under Phusion
Passenger. The bulk of the hard work (working out a sane way to do it)
was done Chris Parsons, and you can read about how he did it in his
[Multiple CI Joes with Rack and
Passenger](http://chrismdp.github.com/2010/03/multiple-ci-joes-with-rack-and-passenger/)
blog post.
